                    </h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Many European cities still bear reminders of the power of ancient Rome, and throughout the
                            western world the influence of Roman power is still manifest. Architecture was crucial to
                            the success of Rome.</li>

                        <li>Roman temples, while related to the Greek temple form in general design and use of the
                            Classical orders, represent a very defined category of temple form. The distinctive elements
                            of being raised on a podium, having a front staircase, and having the columns along the
                            sides being attached or engaged (pseudo-peripteral) allow for the easy identification of a
                            Roman temple. For a Roman citizen from Syria to England, the appearance of this form of
                            temple and the cult practices associated with it provided a sense of membership in the
                            empire. </li>

                        <li>Echoes of the tradition of the Roman Empire are found in cities throughout the western
                            world. Nations and leaders to give visual testament to their authority and power have
                            emulated the distinct forms of Roman architecture.</li>

                            <li>The Slave Lodge was built in 1679, making it the second oldest existing colonial
                                structure of the Cape Colony, today known as Cape Town</li>

                            <li> This building was changed many times and it is unclear how much of the existing
                                building dates from the slave period.



                                The building was used as a slave lodge until 1811 when it was changed into government
                                offices by the new British colonial authorities</li>

                            <li>The Slave Lodge housed the slaves who belonged to the Dutch East India Company (VOC).
                                These slaves worked for the VOC and were never sold. </li>

                                Hoop) known locally as the Castle[1] or Cape Town Castle[2] is a bastion fort built in
                                the 17th century in Cape Town, South Africa. Originally located on the coastline of
                                Table Bay, following land reclamation the fort is now located inland.</li>

                            <li>Built by the Dutch East India Company between 1666 and 1679, the Castle is the oldest
                                existing building in South Africa.[4] It replaced an older fort called the Fort de Goede
                                Hoop which was constructed from clay and timber and built by Jan van Riebeeck upon his
                                arrival at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652. </li>

                            <li>The purpose of the Dutch settlement in the Cape was to act as a replenishment station
                                for ships passing the treacherous coast around the Cape on long voyages between the
                                Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia).</li>
